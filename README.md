# Chef Claude â€” AI Recipe Generator

Chef Claude is a full-stack AI-powered web application that takes your available ingredients and generates creative recipes using advanced language models like **Claude 3 Haiku** (via Anthropic API) and **Mixtral-8x7B** (via HuggingFace Inference API). 

Built using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend, this app demonstrates secure API integration, smooth client-server communication, and deployment on **Render**.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

Chef Claude allows users to:
- Dynamically add ingredients
- Fetch a recipe suggestion using Claude or Mistral
- View results in markdown-formatted display
- Switch backend model easily
- Deploy securely with environment variables and backend proxying

The architecture ensures that **no API keys are exposed on the frontend**, as all AI communication happens through a Node.js backend.
